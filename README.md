## PairingSpecialCharacterCounter v. 0.9 alpha

This program opens a text file and counts the total number of characters, the number of quotation marks (" "), the number of open and close parentheses (), the number of open and close brackets ([]), the number of open and close braces ({}), and the number of double less than and double greater than signs (<< >>), and assumes that if the total number of quotation marks is even, they most likely match, then matches up each opening and closing pairing character with each other (basically just by counting them and seeing if the number of opening characters and the number of closing characters of the same kind is equal). When the end of the file is reached, the file is closed, and a report is printed on the screen at the end.
